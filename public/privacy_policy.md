# Privacy Policy

## What Information Do We Collect?

We collect only the information you explicitly provide: an uploaded image, and optionally your name and the dog's breed.

## Why is the Information Collected?

The dog images will be used in an app to teach people to recognise dog breeds by sight. They will not be used for anything else without getting prior permission. Provided names may be made available within the app as credits for the images.

## Who Has Access to the Information?

Your information will not be shared with any third party other than through the app, as described above.

## What Rights Do You Have?

You have the right to request any of your provided data is permanently deleted (and never used for the breed recognition project) at any time. Contact us with information about the image you provided to request this.

## Contact Details

You can contact us by email at imperialoctopus@gmail.com.
